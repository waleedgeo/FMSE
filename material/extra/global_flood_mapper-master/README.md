<h1> Global Flood Mapper (GFM) </h1><br/>
This repository contains the link to the global flood mapper tool as described in the article <em><strong>"Global Flood Mapper: a novel Google Earth Engine application for rapid flood mapping using Sentinel‑1 SAR"</strong></em>.<br/>

Please read the usage instructions here [[link]](/instructions). Details of the tool can be found in the journal article (read full text here [[link]](https://rdcu.be/cP7Od)). Few examples of flood events around the globe can be found here [[link]](/examples).<br/>

The GFM allows the user to quickly create high-precision flood maps by simply selecting the area of interest from the dropwown menu and selecting the dates for before and during floods. The flood map can be directly downloaded from the GFM either in PNG or KML format. The advanced options in the GFM enable the user to tweak parameters that influence the flood map. For instance, choosing between ascending/descending pass, the threshold for Z-value for VV and VH bands, water seasonality threshold, and the elevation and slope mask threshold.
