State: Anatoliki Makedonia Kai Thraki - one has to zoom in to the west of Sığırcı Lake to map the flood extent as shown in image below.<br/>
Pre flood date: 01 Mar 2016 + 30 days (since Jan and Feb 2015 also had some amount of water and Sentinel was not available before that period, it is okay to take a time period after the flood inundation has drained. Because in principle, a time stretch with no flood water is required for reference.)<br/>
